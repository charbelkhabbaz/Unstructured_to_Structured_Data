# Unstructured_to_Structured_Data

**üöÄ Overview**

The AI Data Structuring Platform is a powerful tool designed to transform unstructured data from various formats (PDFs, images, text files) into well-structured, actionable data. Built with Python and Streamlit, this platform leverages advanced AI models to extract, classify, and structure data for easy analysis and integration.

In data engineering, we primarily work with structured data that follows a specific schema or format. This project addresses the critical challenge of converting unstructured or semi-structured documents into a consistent, well-defined structure that can be easily processed, analyzed, and integrated with other data systems.

**‚ú® Key Features**

Multi-Format Support: Process PDFs, images (PNG, JPG, TIFF, BMP), and text files (TXT, CSV, Excel)

Advanced AI Processing: Uses DeepSeek AI models for intelligent data structuring (CHATBOT)

Structured Output: Convert documents to JSON, CSV, or formatted tables (output format)

Entity Extraction: Identify people, organizations, locations, dates, and more

Document Classification: Automatically categorize document types (invoices, reports, etc.)

Performance Monitoring: Track processing times and system resource usage

Customizable: Adjust processing parameters and AI prompts for specific needs

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture**

The platform follows a modular architecture:

1- Data Extraction Layer: Handles PDFs, images, and text files

2- AI Processing Layer: Structures data using DeepSeek models

3-Data Transformation Layer: Formats output as JSON, CSV, or tables

4- Presentation Layer: Streamlit-based web interface

**How to run the project?**

1- Clone the repository 

2- Pip install -r requirements.txt

3- Put your OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

4- Write in the terminal streamlit run app.py
